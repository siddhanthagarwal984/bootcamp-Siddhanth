# Notes on Dynamic Streaming

## Problem Understanding
This module provides functionalities for processing data dynamically using streaming techniques. It includes commands to run a streaming pipeline and various processing functions for text manipulation.

## Approach & Methodology
- Utilize the Typer library to create command-line interfaces for streaming processing.
- Implement functions to handle text transformations in a streaming manner.
- Ensure modular design for easy maintenance and testing.

## Prompts & Responses
**1. How can I apply a streaming pipeline to process text files?**  
Use the `process_stream` command followed by the input file name and output file name to execute the streaming pipeline.

**2. What is the purpose of the `number_the_lines` function?**  
This function adds line numbers to each line of the input text, making it easier to reference specific lines.

**3. How can I remove multiple consecutive empty lines from a text?**  
Use the `coalesce_empty_lines` function to filter out multiple consecutive empty lines, leaving only one.
