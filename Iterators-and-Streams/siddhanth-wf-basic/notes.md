# Notes on Basic Iterators and Streams

## Problem Understanding
This module provides basic functionalities for processing text files using iterators and streams. It includes commands to convert text to upper case and lower case, as well as functions to remove stop words and fetch geographical information based on IP addresses.

## Approach & Methodology
- Utilize the Typer library to create command-line interfaces for text processing.
- Implement functions to handle text transformations and data fetching efficiently.
- Ensure modular design for easy maintenance and testing.

## Prompts & Responses
**1. How can I convert text to upper case using a command line?**  
Use the `upper_case` command followed by the input file name to convert its contents to upper case.

**2. What is the purpose of the `remove_stop_words` function?**  
This function filters out common stop words from a given text, allowing for more meaningful data processing.

**3. How can I fetch geographical information based on an IP address?**  
Use the `fetch_geo_ip` function with the desired IP address to retrieve location data.
