# Notes on Dynamic Iterators and Streams

## Problem Understanding
This module provides functionalities for processing data dynamically using YAML configurations. It includes commands to run a transformation pipeline and various processing functions for text manipulation.

## Approach & Methodology
- Utilize the Typer library to create command-line interfaces for dynamic processing.
- Implement functions to handle text transformations based on user-defined YAML configurations.
- Ensure modular design for easy maintenance and testing.

## Prompts & Responses
**1. How can I run a transformation pipeline using a YAML config file?**  
Use the `run_pipeline` command followed by the input file name, YAML config file, and output file name to execute the pipeline.

**2. What is the purpose of the `process_pipeline` function?**  
This function reads the YAML configuration and applies the specified transformations to the input file, saving the results to the output file.

**3. How can I remove stop words from a text?**  
Use the `remove_stop_words` function with the desired text to filter out common stop words.
