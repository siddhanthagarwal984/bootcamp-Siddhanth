GPT-4 was used to assist in integrating exception handling into the pipeline.

## Prompts & Responses
**1. How can I integrate exception handling in my processing pipeline?**  
Use try-except blocks around critical sections of your code to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.

**2. What types of exceptions should I handle in a file processing pipeline?**  
Handle exceptions such as `FileNotFoundError`, `IOError`, and any custom exceptions relevant to your processing logic.

**3. Can I log errors that occur during processing?**  
Yes, you can log errors using the logging module to keep track of issues that arise during processing.
