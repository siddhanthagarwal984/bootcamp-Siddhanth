# Chaining Iterators

## Problem Understanding
Utilize itertools.chain to combine multiple iterators into one.

## Approach & Methodology
- Create a combined iterator from several range objects and process them.
- Explain how chaining can simplify working with multiple iterators.
- Provide examples of using chained iterators in practice.

## LLMs Used
GPT-4 was used to assist in creating chained iterators.

## Prompts & Responses
**1. How can I chain multiple iterators in Python?**  
Use `itertools.chain()` to combine multiple iterators into a single iterator.

**2. What are the benefits of chaining iterators?**  
Chaining allows for seamless iteration over multiple data sources without needing to manage them separately.

**3. Can I chain iterators of different types?**  
Yes, you can chain iterators of different types as long as they are iterable.
