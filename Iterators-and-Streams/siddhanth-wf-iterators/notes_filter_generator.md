# Filtering Data with Iterators

## Problem Understanding
Enhance the file-reading generator to filter out lines that don't meet a certain condition.

## Approach & Methodology
- Filter lines that do not contain a specific word.
- Explain how filtering can be implemented in generators.
- Provide examples of using filtered generators in practice.

## LLMs Used
GPT-4 was used to assist in creating a filtered generator.

## Prompts & Responses
**1. How can I filter data in a generator?**  
Use a conditional statement within the generator to yield only the lines that meet your criteria.

**2. What are the benefits of filtering data with generators?**  
Filtering with generators allows for efficient data processing without loading unnecessary data into memory.

**3. Can I chain multiple filters in a generator?**  
Yes, you can chain multiple filters by using additional conditions or by combining multiple generator expressions.
