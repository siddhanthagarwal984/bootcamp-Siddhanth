# Basic Iterator Creation

## Problem Understanding
Create a simple iterator that yields numbers from 1 to 10.

## Approach & Methodology
- Use a for loop to iterate over this iterator and print the numbers.
- Explain how iterators work in Python and their benefits.
- Provide examples of using iterators in practice.

## LLMs Used
GPT-4 was used to assist in creating a basic iterator.

## Prompts & Responses
**1. How can I create a simple iterator in Python?**  
Define a class with a `__iter__` method that returns an iterator object.

**2. What is the purpose of using iterators?**  
Iterators allow for lazy evaluation and efficient looping over data without loading everything into memory.

**3. Can I use a for loop with my custom iterator?**  
Yes, you can use a for loop to iterate over your custom iterator just like built-in iterators.
