# Custom Iterator for File Reading

## Problem Understanding
Write a custom iterator that reads a file line by line.

## Approach & Methodology
- Test this by reading a sample text file and printing each line.
- Explain how custom iterators can be used to read files efficiently.
- Provide examples of using file iterators in practice.

## LLMs Used
GPT-4 was used to assist in creating a custom file iterator.

## Prompts & Responses
**1. How can I create a custom iterator for reading a file?**  
Define a class with `__iter__` and `__next__` methods to read lines from the file.

**2. What are the advantages of using a custom file iterator?**  
Custom file iterators allow for more control over how files are read and can handle large files efficiently.

**3. Can I use a for loop with my custom file iterator?**  
Yes, you can use a for loop to iterate over your custom file iterator just like built-in file objects.
