# Creating a Stream Processing Function

## Problem Understanding
Write a function that takes an iterator as input and processes its items, e.g., multiplying numbers by 2.

## Approach & Methodology
- Test this with a range iterator.
- Explain how stream processing can be applied to iterators.
- Provide examples of using stream processing functions in practice.

## LLMs Used
GPT-4 was used to assist in creating a stream processing function.

## Prompts & Responses
**1. How can I create a stream processing function in Python?**  
Define a function that accepts an iterator and processes each item using a loop or comprehension.

**2. What are the benefits of stream processing?**  
Stream processing allows for real-time data handling and can improve performance by processing data on-the-fly.

**3. Can I use a generator as an input for my stream processing function?**  
Yes, generators are perfect for stream processing as they yield items one at a time, making them memory efficient.
