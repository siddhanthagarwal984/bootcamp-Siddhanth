# Handling Large Files Efficiently

## Problem Understanding
Modify the file processing pipeline to handle large files efficiently without loading the entire file into memory.

## Approach & Methodology
- Explain how to read files in chunks or line by line.
- Discuss the importance of memory efficiency in data processing.
- Provide examples of efficient file handling techniques.

## LLMs Used
GPT-4 was used to assist in creating an efficient file processing solution.

## Prompts & Responses
**1. How can I handle large files efficiently in Python?**  
Read files in chunks or use generators to process data line by line without loading everything into memory.

**2. What are the benefits of processing files in chunks?**  
Processing in chunks reduces memory usage and allows for handling larger datasets that wouldn't fit in memory all at once.

**3. Can I combine chunk processing with filtering?**  
Yes, you can filter data as you read it in chunks, allowing for efficient data processing and reduced memory usage.
