# Using Dunder Methods

This folder extends the `Book` class by adding `__str__` and `__repr__` methods.

## Files
- `book.py` - Defines the `Book` class with dunder methods.
- `main.py` - Creates instances and tests string representations.

## Usage
Run `python main.py` to see how `__str__` and `__repr__` work.
