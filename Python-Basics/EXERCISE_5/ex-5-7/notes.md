# ex-5-7: Using Dunder Methods for Arithmetic

## Problem Understanding
Implement `__add__`, `__sub__`, and other arithmetic dunder methods in a Vector class.

## Approach & Methodology
- Test the class with vector addition, subtraction, etc.
- Explain how dunder methods enhance the functionality of the class.
- Provide examples of using these methods in practice.

## LLMs Used
GPT-4 was used to assist in implementing arithmetic dunder methods in the Vector class.

## Prompts & Responses
**Prompt:**  
How can I implement arithmetic dunder methods in a Vector class?

**Response:**  
Define methods like `__add__` and `__sub__` to handle vector addition and subtraction.

**Prompt:**  
What is the purpose of dunder methods?

**Response:**  
Dunder methods allow you to define how objects of your class behave with built-in operations like addition and subtraction.

**Prompt:**  
Can I use dunder methods to implement other operations like multiplication?

**Response:**  
Yes, you can implement `__mul__` for multiplication and other arithmetic operations as needed.
