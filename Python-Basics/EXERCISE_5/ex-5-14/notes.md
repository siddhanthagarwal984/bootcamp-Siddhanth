Overload comparison operators in a class.

## Approach & Methodology
- Implement `__eq__`, `__lt__`, etc., in a class to enable direct object comparisons.
- Explain how operator overloading enhances the usability of custom classes.
- Provide examples of using overloaded operators in practice.

## LLMs Used
GPT-4 was used to assist in implementing operator overloading in a class.

## Prompts & Responses
**Prompt:**  
How can I overload comparison operators in Python?

**Response:**  
Define methods like `__eq__` for equality and `__lt__` for less than in your class.

**Prompt:**  
What is the benefit of operator overloading?

It allows objects of your class to be compared using standard operators, making the code more intuitive.

**Prompt:**  
Can I overload multiple operators in a single class?

**Response:**  
Yes, you can overload multiple operators by defining their corresponding dunder methods in the class.
