# ex-5-11: Static Variables and Methods

## Problem Understanding
Explore the use of static variables and methods in a class.

## Approach & Methodology
- Track the number of instances created for a class using a static variable.
- Explain how static methods can be used to access static variables.
- Provide examples of how static variables maintain state across instances.

## LLMs Used
GPT-4 was used to assist in exploring static variables and methods in a class.

## Prompts & Responses
**Prompt:**  
How can I implement static variables in a class?

**Response:**  
Define a class variable that is shared among all instances of the class.

**Prompt:**  
What is the difference between instance variables and static variables?

**Response:**  
Instance variables are unique to each instance, while static variables are shared across all instances.

**Prompt:**  
Can I access static variables from instance methods?

**Response:**  
Yes, you can access static variables from instance methods using the class name or directly.
