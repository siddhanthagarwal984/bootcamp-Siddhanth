# functools.lru_cache for Optimization

## Problem Statement
Write a recursive function to calculate Fibonacci numbers and optimize it using functools.lru_cache.

## Solution
- The `@lru_cache` decorator caches previous results to avoid redundant calculations.
- This significantly improves performance when computing large Fibonacci numbers.

## Example Output
