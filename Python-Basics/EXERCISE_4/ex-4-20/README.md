# Combining functools with List Comprehensions

## Problem Statement
Use functools.reduce along with a list comprehension to calculate the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 10.

## Solution
- A list comprehension generates a list of squares from `1` to `n`.
- `functools.reduce` applies a lambda function to sum all elements in the list.
