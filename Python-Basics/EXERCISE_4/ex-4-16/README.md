# List Comprehension with Multiple Iterables

## Problem Statement
Generate all possible pairs (as tuples) of numbers from two different lists using a list comprehension.

## Solution
- We iterate over both lists simultaneously inside a list comprehension.
- The result is a list of tuples, each containing a pair of elements from both lists.

## Example Output
