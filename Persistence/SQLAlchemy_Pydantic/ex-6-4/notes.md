# Notes on Converting Everything to Async

## Problem Understanding
This script converts the user operations to asynchronous functions using SQLAlchemy's async capabilities.

## Approach & Methodology
Use asyncpg for PostgreSQL with async SQLAlchemy, modify queries to work with async sessions, and ensure async-safe user retrieval and insertion.

## LLMs Used
GPT-4 was used to assist in converting the user operations to asynchronous functions.

## Prompts & Responses
**Prompt:**  
How do I convert my SQLAlchemy operations to async?

**Response:**  
Use the async version of SQLAlchemy and modify your session and query methods to be async.

**Prompt:**  
What are the benefits of using async with SQLAlchemy?

**Response:**  
Async operations can improve performance by allowing other tasks to run while waiting for database operations to complete.

**Prompt:**  
How can I handle errors in async operations?

**Response:**  
Use try-except blocks to catch exceptions and handle them appropriately in your async functions.
