# Notes on Versioning Serialized Objects

## Problem Understanding
This script handles version changes in serialized objects, allowing for backward compatibility.

## Approach & Methodology
Implement version handling in the serialization and deserialization methods of the Document class.

## LLMs Used
GPT-4 was used to assist in creating version handling logic for serialized objects.

## Prompts & Responses
**Prompt:**  
How do I handle version changes in serialized objects?

**Response:**  
Implement logic in the deserialization method to check the version and handle it accordingly.

**Prompt:**  
What is the expected output when loading an old version of the object?

**Response:**  
The object will be reconstructed based on the version-specific logic defined in the class.

**Prompt:**  
How can I ensure backward compatibility with older versions?

**Response:**  
Define clear versioning in your class and implement conditional logic to handle different versions during deserialization.
