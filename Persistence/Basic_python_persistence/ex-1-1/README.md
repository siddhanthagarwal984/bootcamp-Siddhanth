# Basic Serialization with Pickle

This module demonstrates how to serialize a simple `Person` object using `pickle`.

## Running the Serialization

poetry run python persistence_demo/serialize.py

or

poetry run python -m persistence_demo.serialize
(The -m flag tells Python to treat persistence_demo as a module, ensuring correct package resolution.)

## Running Tests

poetry run pytest
