# Notes on Serialization of Custom Collections

## Problem Understanding
This script implements serialization for a custom collection class, allowing for storage and retrieval of items.

## Approach & Methodology
Define a MyCollection class with methods to add items and serialize the collection to a file using pickle.

## LLMs Used
GPT-4 was used to assist in creating serialization logic for the custom collection.

## Prompts & Responses
**Prompt:**  
How do I serialize a custom collection class?

**Response:**  
Implement a method that converts the collection's items into a serializable format, such as using pickle.

**Prompt:**  
What is the expected output when serializing the MyCollection object?

**Response:**  
The MyCollection object will be serialized to a file, allowing for later retrieval of the items.

**Prompt:**  
How can I ensure that the collection is deserialized correctly?

**Response:**  
Implement a method that reads the serialized file and reconstructs the collection object from it.
