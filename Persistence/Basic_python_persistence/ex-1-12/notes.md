# Notes on Serializing Cyclic References

## Problem Understanding
This script handles serialization of objects with cyclic references, allowing for proper storage and retrieval.

## Approach & Methodology
Define a Node class with methods to set references and implement serialization logic that can handle cycles.

## LLMs Used
GPT-4 was used to assist in creating serialization logic for cyclic references.

## Prompts & Responses
**Prompt:**  
How do I serialize objects with cyclic references?

**Response:**  
Use a serialization method that can handle cycles, such as using pickle in Python.

**Prompt:**  
What is the expected output when serializing cyclic references?

**Response:**  
The cyclic references will be preserved in the serialized output, allowing for correct deserialization.

**Prompt:**  
How can I ensure that deserialization works correctly for cyclic references?

**Response:**  
Implement a deserialization method that can reconstruct the object graph accurately, maintaining the cycles.
