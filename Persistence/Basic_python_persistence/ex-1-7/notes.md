# Notes on Custom Serialization for Complex Objects

## Problem Understanding
This script implements custom serialization logic for a Graph object containing nodes and edges.

## Approach & Methodology
Define a Graph class with methods to add nodes and edges, and implement a method to serialize the graph to JSON.

## LLMs Used
GPT-4 was used to assist in creating custom serialization logic for the Graph object.

## Prompts & Responses
**Prompt:**  
How do I serialize a complex object like a graph?

**Response:**  
Implement a method that converts the object's attributes into a serializable format, such as JSON.

**Prompt:**  
What is the expected output when serializing the Graph object?

**Response:**  
The Graph object will be converted to a JSON string representation, including nodes and edges.

**Prompt:**  
How can I ensure that the serialization handles complex data structures?

**Response:**  
Use a structured approach to define how each part of the object should be serialized, ensuring all necessary data is included.
