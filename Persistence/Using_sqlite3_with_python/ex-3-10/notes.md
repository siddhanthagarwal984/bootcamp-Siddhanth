# Notes on Data Validation

## Problem Understanding
This script defines a `ProductManager` class that handles SQLite operations with data validation for product entries.

## Approach & Methodology
Implement validation checks to ensure that the product name is a non-empty string and the price is a positive number before inserting or updating records.

## LLMs Used
GPT-4 was used to assist in creating the data validation logic for the ProductManager class.

## Prompts & Responses
**Prompt:**  
How do I validate data before inserting it into a SQLite table?

**Response:**  
Implement checks to ensure that the data meets the required criteria, such as type and value constraints.

**Prompt:**  
What should I do if the validation fails?

**Response:**  
Print an error message and prevent the insertion or update from occurring.

**Prompt:**  
How can I enforce data types in the database schema?
