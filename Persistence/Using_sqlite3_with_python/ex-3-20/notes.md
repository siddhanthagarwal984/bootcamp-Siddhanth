# Notes on Complex Business Logic with Transactions

## Problem Understanding
This script defines a function to update the inventory count of a product and log the change in the inventory_log table, ensuring that both operations are performed within a single transaction.

## Approach & Methodology
Use transactions to ensure that the inventory update and logging are committed only if both operations succeed, rolling back in case of errors.

## LLMs Used
GPT-4 was used to assist in creating the transaction handling logic for inventory management.

## Prompts & Responses
**Prompt:**  
How do I implement complex business logic with transactions in SQLite using Python?

Wrap your update and log operations in a transaction using `BEGIN TRANSACTION;` and `commit()` to finalize changes.

**Prompt:**  
What should I do if the inventory update fails?

**Response:**  
Use a try-except block to catch exceptions and call `rollback()` to revert changes if an error occurs.
